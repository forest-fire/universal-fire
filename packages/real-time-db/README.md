> The underlying library powering `abstracted-admin` and `abstracted-client`

## Basic Usage

It would be unusual to use this library directly, instead it is expected that you would choose one of the following:

* [`abstracted-admin`](https://abstracted-admin.com) - if you're building a backend service and want to leverage the Firebase Admin API
* `abstracted-client` - if instead you're more interested in working in the client browser then this is the right choice

Both the aforementioned libraries use this library for a majority of their common functionality.
